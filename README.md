## Introduction

The rapid evolution of digital technologies has increased the vulnerability to cyber threats such as malware, phishing, and network intrusions. This project aims to design and implement an advanced cyber threat detection system leveraging both machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Motivation and Contributions

This research is motivated by the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber threats, which challenge the security of digital systems globally. The project integrates ML and DL methods, specifically through the application of XGBoost and advanced deep learning models like stacking and hybrid approaches.

## System Design

The cyber threat detection system architecture is designed to:
- Implement machine learning models optimized for threat detection using the NSL-KDD dataset.
- Develop advanced deep learning models to enhance detection accuracy.
- Plan real-time data integration for continuous monitoring and enhanced deployment pipelines.

## Implementation Details

### Data Collection and Preparation
The NSL-KDD dataset is used for training and testing the models, categorized into normal traffic and various types of attacks, including DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R.

### Model Selection and Training
Several models were implemented:
- **XGBoost**: For efficient, high-performance decision trees.
- **Stacking Models**: Combining predictions of multiple algorithms to improve accuracy.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining ML with DL to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

### Evaluation
Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score across all attack categories.

## Results

The results indicate that the hybrid model offered significant improvements in detection accuracy and generalization, outperforming traditional methods. The final system exhibits a high detection rate, low false-positive rate, and strong adaptability to evolving cyber threats.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the potential of integrating ML and DL techniques for cyber threat detection and sets a foundation for future research and development in the field of cybersecurity.

## Future Work

Future efforts will focus on optimizing models, scaling for large-scale deployments, integrating real-time data streams, and applying the models to other domains like IoT security.
